# Task Manager

This a simple application to maintain tasks.

It uses a JavaScript frontend with React and a Java backend with Spring Boot.

In the frontend it uses React, Normalize CSS, Material UI framework library,
Materialize CSS, Bootstrap and Bootstrap Material Design.

In the backend it uses Spring Boot, MySQL database and Apache Commons helpers.

It also uses Ruby Foreman gem to run the client and server tasks in parallel.

For now Spring Boot is configured to discard persisted data when the application starts.
